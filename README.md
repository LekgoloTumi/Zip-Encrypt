# Production
This code essentially solves a problem I encountered when trying to encrypt a Zip file in C#

Problem Solving Approach:

1. After doing thorough research I concluded that the AES encryption algorithm would be the best to encrypt my file
2. I researched which library using AES is the best and landed on the Aspose.Zip library
3. I then coded the encryption for the Zip file using the Aspose.Zip library.
